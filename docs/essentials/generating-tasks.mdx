description: 'CLI command to add a task to your project'

To generate a new task for your project, run:

```bash
agentstack generate task <task_name>
```

This command will modify two files, your agent file (`crew.py`/`graph.py`) and `agents.yaml`.

## your agent file

This is the file that declares each of your agents and tasks. It's the core of your AgentStack project and how AgentStack configures your framework.
- Crew projects have `crew.py`
- LangGraph projects have `graph.py`

## agents.yaml

This is your prompt file. Any prompt engineering is abstracted to here for non-technical ease.

Each task has two prompt params:
- Description
- Expected Output

And one configuration param:
- Agent - If operating in Sequential mode, this tells the Crew which agent should accomplish the task
