## Quick Overview

```sh
pip install agentstack
agentstack init
```

### Get Started Immediately

You **don't** need to install or configure tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you're good to go.

## Creating an Agent Project

**You'll need to have Python 3.10+ on your local development machine** (but it's not required on the server). We recommend using the latest version. You can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to switch Python versions between different projects.

To create a new agent project, run:

```sh
pip install agentstack
agentstack init my-agent-project
```

It will create a directory called `my-agent-project` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-agent-project/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── .gitignore
├── main.py
├── agents/
│   └── (agent files based on your setup)
└── tasks/
    └── (task files based on your setup)
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your agent project.<br>
Once the initialization is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-agent-project
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `python main.py`

Runs the agent project in development mode.<br>

## Philosophy

- **Agents should be easy:** There are so many frameworks out there, but starting from scratch is a pain. Similar to Create React App, Agent Stack aims to simplify the "from scratch" process by giving you a simple boilerplate of an agent. It uses popular agent frameworks and LLM providers, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

- **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

- **No Lock-In:** You can customize your setup at any time. Agent Stack is designed to make it easy to get the components you need running right off the bat; it's up to you what to do next.

## What's Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern AI agent project:

- Support for popular agent frameworks like CrewAI, Autogen, and LiteLLM.
- Easy integration of tools for browsing, RAG, and more.
- A fast interactive test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle your project for production.
- Integration with [AgentOps](https://agentops.ai) for AI agent observability.
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.
