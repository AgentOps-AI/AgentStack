# Pipedream Components

The Pipedream integration allows you to use pre-built components from Pipedream's extensive library directly in your agent projects. This integration supports both actions (synchronous operations) and sources (event-driven triggers).

## Setup

1. Install the Pipedream tool:
```bash
agentstack tools add pipedream
```

2. Configure your API key:
   - Get your API key from [Pipedream Settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/api-key)
   - Add it to your .env file:
     ```
     PIPEDREAM_API_KEY=your-pipedream-api-key
     ```

## Component Props

Props are predefined configuration parameters in Pipedream components. They:
- Are defined in the component code
- Cannot be created by end users
- Support both static and dynamic configurations
- Are configured through specific API endpoints

Users can configure prop values but cannot create new props. Props must be defined by component developers following Pipedream's component structure.

## Component Types

Pipedream components come in two types:

### Actions
- **What are they?** Synchronous operations that execute immediately and return a result
- **Use cases:** Making API calls, processing data, performing one-time operations
- **Tool to use:** `PipedreamActionTool`
- **Example usage:**
  ```yaml
  # config/agents.yaml
  agents:
    - name: PipedreamAgent
      role: API Integration Specialist
      goal: Execute Pipedream components and handle responses
      tools:
        - PipedreamActionTool

  # config/tasks.yaml
  tasks:
    - name: ExecutePipedreamAction
      agent: PipedreamAgent
      input: |
        Execute the Pipedream component action with:
        - Component ID: "gitlab-list-commits"
        - Input parameters:
          - projectId: 45672541
          - refName: "main"
  ```

### Sources
- **What are they?** Event-driven triggers that listen for events and execute when triggered
- **Use cases:** Webhooks, scheduled tasks, real-time data processing
- **Tool to use:** `PipedreamSourceTool`
- **Requirements:** Public webhook URL for receiving events
- **Example usage:**
  ```yaml
  # config/agents.yaml
  agents:
    - name: PipedreamAgent
      role: API Integration Specialist
      goal: Deploy and manage Pipedream source components
      tools:
        - PipedreamSourceTool

  # config/tasks.yaml
  tasks:
    - name: DeployPipedreamSource
      agent: PipedreamAgent
      input: |
        Deploy a Pipedream source component with:
        - Component ID: "gitlab-new-issue"
        - Webhook URL: "https://events.example.com/gitlab-new-issue"
        - Configuration:
          - projectId: 45672541
  ```

## Error Handling

The Pipedream tools include comprehensive error handling:

- API authentication errors (missing or invalid API key)
- Network request failures
- Invalid JSON responses
- Component-specific errors

Error messages are descriptive and include troubleshooting hints.

## Best Practices

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never commit your API key to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Include placeholder in .env.example

2. **Component Selection**
   - Choose appropriate component type (action vs source)
   - Test components individually before integration
   - Review component documentation for required parameters

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always handle potential errors in your agent tasks
   - Validate inputs before execution
   - Monitor source component health

## Limitations

- Pipedream Connect is currently in beta
- Some components may require additional authentication
- Source components need a publicly accessible webhook URL
