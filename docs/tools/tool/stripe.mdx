## Description

Use Stripe to run your agent business and enhance your agentsâ€™ functionality. By enabling access to financial services and tools, you allow your agents to help you earn and spend funds, expanding their capabilities.

## Example

Add the Stripe tool with
```bash
agentstack tools add stripe
```

Create your API key from your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).

## Tools

Stripe has a number of APIs exposed for agent use. By default, the agent will have access to

```python
{
    "actions": {
        "payment_links": {
            "create": True,
        },
        "products": {
            "create": True,
        },
        "prices": {
            "create": True,
        },
    }
}
```
