## Initialize a new project

AgentStack's greatest ability is that of quickly scaffolding agent projects

To start, ensure you have AgentStack [installed](/installation) and run:
```bash
agentstack init <project_name>
```


**With the Wizard**

Optionally, if you're a little overwhelmed with the code generated, you can use our Wizard to help guide you through some core setup!
```bash
agentstack init <project_name> --wizard
```

**With a Template**

By default, your project will contain no agents or tasks.

If you find it easier to start with a complete project and edit it to fit your use-case, you can use [Templates](/templates/templates)

```bash
agentstack init --template=<template_name/url>
```

## Building your project

AgentStack 0.3 and beyond is framework-agnostic! Choose any supported framework and start building. We help you scaffold your project quickly, but building complex routing and workflows is still done at the framework level. Be sure to understand how to build with your framework and turn to their documentation for guidance.

### Agents

To generate a new agent, run `agentstack generate agent <agent_name>` - [More Info](/essentials/generating-agents)

### Tasks

To generate a new task, run `agentstack generate task <task_name>` - [More Info](/essentials/generating-tasks)
