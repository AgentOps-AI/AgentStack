## Overview

[cognee](https://www.cognee.ai/) is an AI memory engine designed to improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). It connects data points to uncover hidden links, providing your LLM applications with a better understanding of your data, leading to more reliable responses.

## Installation

1. To install the `cognee` tool in AgentStack, run:

```bash
agentstack tools add cognee

2. Set Environment Variables:
Configure the necessary environment variables in your environment or .env file. For the default setup you only need to add your `LLM_API_KEY`. Adjust other configurations as needed based on your setup.

## Usage
Cognee provides a suite of tools to manage and utilize AI memory effectively. Below is a set of tools available to AgentStack and their functionalities:

### Available Tools
- prune_data: Cleanses the cognee data store, with an option to include system metadata.
- add_data: Adds any data to cognee's data store for future processing.
- cognify: Processes the added data to build a knowledge graph, summaries, and other metadata.
- search_insights: Performs an insights search on the knowledge graph based on a query.
- search_summaries: Searches for summaries related to the query in the knowledge graph.
- search_chunks: Searches for specific chunks of data related to the query.
- search_completion: Retrieves the document chunk most relevant to the user's query and prompts the LLM to provide an answer using this context.
- search_graph_completion: Identifies the most related knowledge graph entities, including document chunks, related to the user's query and prompts the LLM to generate a response with this enriched context.

Cognee can be configured for different behaviors by modifying /agentstack/_tools/cognee/__init__.py


### Example

#### Using cognee for your Agent's tasks

**Description:**

1. **Prune Data:** Start by pruning existing data in cognee to ensure a clean slate.
2. **Add Data:** Provide text into cognee's knowledge base. Example: "Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and information retrieval."
3. **Cognify:** Process the added text to build the knowledge graph and related metadata.
4. **Search:** Perform searches using cognee's search functions with a query. Example: "Tell me about NLP". Present each search result separately, specifying the function name used for each search type.

**Expected Output:**

The agent should retrieve answers from the provided text based on the query.
