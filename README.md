> üõ†Ô∏èüö® AgentStack is in open preview. We're building in public, use at your own risk but have fun :)

AgentStack serves as a great tool for starting your agent project and offers many CLI utilities for easy code-gen throughout the development process.

AgentStack is _not_ a low-code alternative to development. Developers will still need an understanding of how to build with their selected agent framework.

## Quick Overview

```sh
pip install agentstack
agentstack init
```

### Get Started Immediately

You **don't** need to install or configure tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you're good to go.

## Creating an Agent Project

**You'll need to have Python 3.10+ on your local development machine** (but it's not required on the server). We recommend using the latest version. You can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to switch Python versions between different projects.

To create a new agent project, run:

```sh
pip install agentstack
agentstack init
```

It will create a directory called `my-agent-project` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-agent-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (agent files based on your setup)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (task files based on your setup)
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your agent project.<br>
Once the initialization is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-agent-project
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `python main.py`

Runs the agent project in development mode.<br>

## Philosophy

- **Agents should be easy:** There are so many frameworks out there, but starting from scratch is a pain. Similar to `create-react-app`, AgentStack aims to simplify the "from scratch" process by giving you a simple boilerplate of an agent. It uses popular agent frameworks and LLM providers, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

- **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

- **No Lock-In:** You can customize your setup at any time. AgentStack is designed to make it easy to get the components you need running right off the bat; it's up to you what to do next.

AgentStack is not designed to be a low-code solution to building agents. Instead it is a great head-start for starting an agent project from scratch. 

## What's Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern AI agent project:

- Support for popular agent frameworks like CrewAI, Autogen, and LiteLLM.
- Easy integration of tools for browsing, RAG, and more.
- A fast interactive test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle your project for production.
- Integration with [AgentOps](https://agentops.ai) for AI agent observability.
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

## Roadmap

### Frameworks

#### CrewAI
Development of AgentStack is being done primarily on [CrewAI](https://crewai.com).

#### AutoGen
Some work has been done to add Microsoft's [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/), although these efforts have been paused. AutoGen is currently in the process of making [large design decisions](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/) that will effect the integration with AgentStack.

### Tools
Many tools are currently supported. The short-term roadmap includes:
* MultiOn
* Firecrawl
* Anon
* E2B
* More

### Other Features
* Generated testing
* Integrated benchmarking
