### With the CLI

```bash
agentstack init sentiment_analyser

agentstack generate agent web_scraper
agentstack generate task scrape_data

agentstack generate agent analyser
agentstack generate task sentiment_analysis

agentstack tools add agentql
```

## How to use your Crew

In this directory, run `poetry install`

To run your project, use the following command:  
`agentstack run`

This will initialize your crew of AI agents and begin task execution as defined in your configuration in the main.py file.

#### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff:

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run:  
`crewai replay <task_id>`  
Replace <task_id> with the ID of the task you want to replay.

#### Reset Crew Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:  
`crewai reset-memory`  
This will clear the crew's memory, allowing for a fresh start.
