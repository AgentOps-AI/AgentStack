_Templates are a really powerful tool within AgentStack!_

# Start a new project with a template
Initializing a new project with AgentStack involves adding just one argument:
```bash
agentstack init --template=<template_name>
```

Templates can also be passed as a URL. The URL should serve a valid json AgentStack template.

## Start Easier
If you're struggling to get started with a project in AgentStack, a great way to better understand what to do is to start with a template!

## Churn Faster
Many contractors that build agent systems have a tried and true prompting method that they want to replicate more quickly.
By creating your own template, you can quickly start projects that adhere to your design.

## For Content Creators
Have a tutorial you've created using AgentStack? Make your project available as a quickstart with templates.

# Built-In Templates

The following templates are built into the AgentStack project. Template contributions are welcome!
