description: 'CLI command to add an agent to your project'
---

To generate a new agent for your project, run:

```bash
agentstack generate agent <agent_name>
```

This command will modify two files, `crew.py` and `agents.yaml`.

## crew.py

This is the file that declares each of your agents and tasks. It's the core of your AgentStack project with Crew.


## agents.yaml

This is your prompt file. Any prompt engineering is abstracted to here for non-technical ease.

Each agent has three prompt params:
- Role
- Goal
- Backstory

And one configuration param:
- LLM - This value tells crew which model to use for this specific agent. It must be in `<provider>/<model>` format

    Ex: `openai/gpt-4o`
