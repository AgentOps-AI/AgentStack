    AgentQL query to scrape the url.

Here is a guide on AgentQL query syntax:

Enclose all AgentQL query terms within curly braces `{}`. The following query structure isn't valid because the term "social\_media\_links" is wrongly enclosed within parenthesis `()`.

```
( # Should be {
    social_media_links(The icons that lead to Facebook, Snapchat, etc.)[]
) # Should be }
```

The following query is also invalid since its missing the curly braces `{}`

```
# should include {
social_media_links(The icons that lead to Facebook, Snapchat, etc.)[]
# should include }
```

You can't include new lines in your semantic context. The following query structure isn't valid because the semantic context isn't contained within one line.

```
{
    social_media_links(The icons that lead
        to Facebook, Snapchat, etc.)[]
}
```
