First of all, __thank you__ for your interest in contributing to AgentStack! Even the smallest contributions help a _ton_.

Our vision is to build the de facto CLI for quickly spinning up an AI Agent project. We want to be the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) of agents. Our inspiration also includes the oh-so-convenient [Angular CLI](https://v17.angular.io/cli).

## How to Help

Grab an issue from the [issues tab](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack/issues)! Plenty are labelled "Good First Issue". Fork the repo and create a PR when ready!

The best place to engage in conversation about your contribution is in the Issue chat or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JdWkh9tgTQ).

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `poetry install`
3. `pip install -e .`
   - This will install the CLI locally and in editable mode so you can use `agentstack <command>` to test your latest changes

## Project Structure

## Tests
