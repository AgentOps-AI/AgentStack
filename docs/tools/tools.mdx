## Installation

Once you find the right tool for your use-case, install it with simply
```bash
agentstack tools add
```

You can also specify a tool, and one or more agents to install it to:
```bash
agentstack tools add <tool_name> --agents=<agent_name1>,<agent_name2>
```

<Note>
    Add your own tool to the AgentStack repo [here](/contributing/adding-tools)!
