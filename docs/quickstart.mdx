## Initialize a new project

AgentStack's greatest ability is that of quickly scaffolding agent projects

### Wizard

AgentStack v0.1 supports a friendly setup wizard!

To start, ensure you have AgentStack [installed](/installation) and run:
```bash
agentstack init
```

<Note>Using the wizard is recommended in AgentStack version 0.1 (current release)</Note>


### Without Wizard

Starting a project without the wizard is useful if you are past the ideation stage and want to just start with a default project template:
```bash
agentstack init --no-wizard
```

## Building your project

By default, your project will contain no agents or tasks.

AgentStack 0.1 is built on top of [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction). The majority of your development experience will be with Crew.

When working with your Crew project, AgentStack makes generating new agents and tasks easy.

### Agents

To generate a new agent, run `agentstack generate agent <agent_name>` - [More Info](/essentials/generating-agents)

### Tasks

To generate a new task, run `agentstack generate task <task_name>` - [More Info](/essentials/generating-tasks)
