title: 'Project Structure'
description: 'Concepts and Structure of AgentStack'
---

> This document is a work-in-progress as we build to version 0.3 and helps
define the structure of the project that we are aiming to create. 

AgentStack is a framework-agnostic toolkit for bootstrapping and managing
AI agents. Out of the box it has support for a number of tools and generates
code to get your project off the ground and deployed to a production environment. 
It also aims to provide robust tooling for running and managing agents including
logging, debugging, deployment, and observability via [AgentOps](https://www.agentops.ai/).

Developers with limited agent experience should be able to get an agentic 
workflow up and running in a matter of minutes. Developers with more experience
should be able to leverage the tools provided by AgentStack to create more
complex workflows and deploy them to production with ease.

# Concepts

## Projects
A project is a user's implementation of AgentStack that is used to implement
and agentic workflow. This is a directory the `agentstack` shell command is 
executed from. 

## Frameworks
Frameworks are the target platforms that `agentstack` can generate code for.
We don't implement all of the functionality provided by a framework, but instead
leverage them to create agentic workflows and provide tooling to aid in their
creation and operation. [Documented in Frameworks](#frameworks-1)


# Public API
The public API is available inside of a project after declaring `import agentstack`

## `agentstack.PATH`
`<pathlib.Path>` This is the path to the current project directory.

> TODO: The current project `Path` can be accessed throughout the application
with `agentstack.PATH`.

## `agentstack.FRAMEWORK`
`<Optional[str]>` This is the name of the current framework. If the application 
is not being run from a project directory, this will be `None`.

> TODO: The current framework name can be accessed throughout the application, 
if it is being executed within a project directory, with `agentstack.FRAMEWORK`.
If not inside a project directory, the framework will be `None`; this can be used
to determine if the application has a project available.

## `agentstack.get_inputs()`
`<dict[str, str]>` This function returns the inputs for a project. These are the 
variables that can be used to configure tasks in the project and are stored in the 
`inputs.yaml` file inside the project directory.


# Core
These namespaces occupy the root of `agentstack` and are shared across all
project & frameworks. Methods from these products are generally candidates for 
availability in the public API for use within a project. 

## `agents`
Agents are the actual personalities that accomplish work. We provide tools for
interacting with the `agents.yaml` configuration file in this package. 

## `tasks`
Tasks are the individual units of work that an Agent can perform. `agents` will
use the `tools` they have available to accomplish `tasks`. We provide tools for
interacting with the `tasks.yaml` configuration file in this package.

## `inputs`
Inputs are variable data that can be used to configure `tasks`. Behind the scenes
`inputs` are interpolated into `task` prompts to determine their specialization. 
We provide tools for interacting with the `inputs.yaml` configuration file in this
package. 

> TODO: Command line argument parsing to select which `inputs` to use or provide overrides. 
> TODO: Iterable inputs that can be used to generate `tasks` for multiple sequential runs. 

## `tools`
Tools are implementations from useful third party libraries that are provided 
to Agents in the user's project. Configuration, dependency management, and wrapper 
implementations are provided by AgentStack. Tools implemented at this level are 
framework-agnostic and expose useful implementations as `callable`s for agents to use. 

Details of tool implementations are documented in the [Tools](#tools-1) section.

> TODO: Some frameworks use decorators to prepare tools for use by agents. Determine
what that actually does and if we can do it in an agnostic way that avoids the
need for decorators. Fundamentally a tool is just a `callable` to so we should
be able to keep this simple. 

## `templates`
Templates are configuration data stored in a JSON file that can be used to 
generate an entire project. This is useful for bootstrapping a new project
which adheres to a common pattern or exporting your project to share. 

> TODO: Templates are currently identified as `proj_templates` since they conflict
with the templates used by `generation`. Move existing templates to be part of
the generation package. 

## `log`
AgentStack provides a robust logging interface for tracking and debugging 
agentic workflows. Runs are separated into separate named files for easy tracking
and have standard conventions for outputs from different parts of the system
for parsing. 

> TODO: Logging is not yet this robust. 
> TODO: Rename `logging` to `log` for brevity.

## `serve`
Completed agents can be deployed to the AgentStack cloud service with a single
command. This provides a fast, secure, and publicly available interface for your
agentic workflows.

> TODO: This is under development. 

## `cli`
The command line interface for `agentstack` is provided in this package. Outside
of `main.py` all logic relating to the command line interface resides here. 

> TODO: Code from other parts of the application should always throw exceptions
and leave the CLI to handle error messaging and control flow. 

## `packaging`
We manage dependencies for tools that are added to the project, in addition
to keeping AgentStack up-to-date. 

> TODO: Migrate packaging to use `uv` exclusively.

## `update`
Auto-updates for AgentStack. 


# Tools
> TODO: Tools should be documented here, or in sub-pages of documentation for
an overview of their usage.

# Generation
AgentStack generates code for a number of frameworks. The generated code is
a starting point for a user's project and is meant to be modified and extended
to suit the user's needs.

## `generation.agents`
This is code that creates and modifies the `agents` in a user's project. Agents
include code that is part of a framework-specific entrypoint file.

> TODO: Rename `generation.agent_generation` to `generation.agents`.

## `generation.tasks`
This is code that creates and modifies the `tasks` in a user's project. Tasks
include code that is part of a framework-specific entrypoint file.

> TODO: Rename `generation.task_generation` to `generation.tasks`.

## `generation.tools`
This is code that creates and modifies the `tools` in a user's project. Tools
are imported into the project and available for use by `agents`.

> TODO: Rename `generation.tool_generation` to `generation.tools`.

## `generation.files`
This is code that creates and modifies the `files` in a user's project.

### `agentstack.json`
This is the configuration file for a user's project. It contains the project's
configuration and metadata.

> TODO This could be moved from `generation.files` to `agentstack.config` since 
it's technically a global concept. 

### `.env`
This is the environment file for a user's project. It contains the project's
environment variables. We dynamically modify this file to include relevant
variables to support `tools` that are used in the project.

## `generation.asttools`
Since we're interacting with generated code, we provide a shared toolkit for
common AST operations. 


# Frameworks
AgentStack generates code for a number of frameworks. The generated code is
a starting point for a user's project and is meant to be modified and extended
to suit the user's needs. The `frameworks` package contains code that adapts
general interactions with a framework into a specific implementation.

## `frameworks.FrameworkModule`
This is the base protocol for all framework implementationsâ€“ all implementations
must implement this protocol.

## `frameworks.crewai`
This is the implementation for the CrewAI framework. CrewAI is a framework for
creating and managing AI agents. All code related specifically to CrewAI is
contained in this package.

## `frameworks.openai_swarms`
> TODO: Add OpenAI Swarms as a framework.

## `frameworks.agency_swarm`
> TODO: Add [VRSEN Agency Swarm](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm?tab=readme-ov-file) as a framework.

## `frameworks.langgraph`
> TODO Add [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) as a framework.
