description: 'Contribute your own Agent tool to the ecosystem'

If you're reading this section, you probably have a product that AI agents can use as a tool. We're glad you're here!

Adding tools is easy once you understand the project structure. A few things need to be done for a tool to be considered completely supported:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a config for your tool">
      - Create a new tool config at `agentstack/tools/<your_tool>.json`
      - As an example, look at our [tool config fixture](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack/blob/main/tests/fixtures/tool_config_max.json)
      - AgentStack uses this to know what code to insert where. Follow the structure to add your tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your implementation for each framework">
      - In `agentstack/templates/<framework>/tools`, you'll see other implementations of tools.
      - Build your tool implementation for that framework. This file will be inserted in the user's project.
      - The tools that are exported from this file should be listed in the tool's config json.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your tool">
      Manually test your tool integration by running `agentstack tools add <your_tool>` and ensure it behaves as expected.
      <Note>This must be done within an AgentStack project. To create your test project, run `agentstack init test_proj`, then `cd` into the project and try adding your tool.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a PR to add your tool to the next release">
  </Step>
</Steps>
