## Overview

AgentOps provides monitoring for agents in development and production.
It provides a dashboard for tracking agent performance, session replays, and custom reporting.

Additionally, AgentOps provides session drilldowns for viewing Crew agent interactions, LLM calls, and tool usage in real-time.
This feature is useful for debugging and understanding how agents interact with users as well as other agents.
