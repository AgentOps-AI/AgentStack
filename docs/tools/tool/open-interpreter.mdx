## Description

This tool enables the Agent to execute Python 3 code that it has generated autonomously. The code is run in a secure, isolated environment, ensuring safety regardless of the content.

This functionality is particularly valuable as it allows the Agent to create code, execute it within the same ecosystem,
obtain the results, and utilize that information to inform subsequent decisions and actions.

## Requirements

- Docker
