Use your favorite package manager

<CodeGroup>

```bash PIP
pip install agentstack
```
```bash brew
brew tap agentstack-ai/tap
brew install agentstack
```
```bash uv
uv install agentstack
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    Conda is not supported at this time. AgentStack uses Poetry in your project which [does not play well with Conda](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack/issues/40).
</Note>

## After installing

Run `agentstack --version` to verify that the CLI is installed and accessible.

**Congrats! You now have AgentStack installed in your environment**
