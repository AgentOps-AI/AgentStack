title: 'Project Structure'
description: 'Concepts and Structure of AgentStack'
---

> This document is a work-in-progress as we build to version 0.3 and helps
define the structure of the project that we are aiming to create. 

AgentStack is a framework-agnostic toolkit for bootstrapping and managing
AI agents. Out of the box it has support for a number of tools and generates
code to get your project off the ground and deployed to a production environment. 
It also aims to provide robust tooling for running and managing agents including
logging, debugging, deployment, and observability via [AgentOps](https://www.agentops.ai/).

Developers with limited agent experience should be able to get an agentic 
workflow up and running in a matter of minutes. Developers with more experience
should be able to leverage the tools provided by AgentStack to create more
complex workflows and deploy them to production with ease.

# Concepts

## Projects
A project is a user's implementation of AgentStack that is used to implement
and agentic workflow. This is a directory the `agentstack` shell command is 
executed from. 

## Frameworks
Frameworks are the target platforms that `agentstack` can generate code for.
We don't implement all of the functionality provided by a framework, but instead
leverage them to create agentic workflows and provide tooling to aid in their
creation and operation. [Documented in Frameworks](#frameworks-1)

## Runtime
When a user initiates `agentstack run` the runtime is the environment that is
created to execute the tasks in the project. This includes the environment
variables, the tools that are available, and the agents that are available to
perform work. The [Public API](#public-api) is available to the user's project
at runtime.

### Environment
The environment is the set of variables that are available to the project. The 
user's `~/.env` file is loaded first, and then the project's `.env` file is loaded
to override any variables specific to the project. 


# Public API
The public API is available inside of a project after declaring `import agentstack`.
We intentionally keep the exports sparse to maintain a usable module tree inside
the user's project, while only ever importing the single keyword. 

## `agentstack.conf.PATH`
`<pathlib.Path>` This is the path to the current project directory.

## `agentstack.tools[<tool_name>]`
`<callable>` This is a tool that is available to agents in the project. Tools
are implementations from useful third party libraries that are provided to Agents
in the user's project. Configuration, dependency management, and wrapper
implementations are provided by AgentStack. Tools implemented at this level are
framework-agnostic and expose useful implementations as `callable`s for agents to
including docstrings and type hints.

> TODO: The public tools API is not yet implemented.

## `agentstack.get_framework()`
`<str>` This is the name of the current framework ie. `"crewai"`.

## `agentstack.get_inputs()`
`<dict[str, str]>` This function returns the inputs for a project. These are the 
variables that can be used to configure tasks in the project and are stored in the 
`inputs.yaml` file inside the project directory.

## `agentstack.get_tags()`
`<List[str]>` This function returns the tags for a project. These are strings
that help identify the workflow in an `AgentOps` observability context.

# Core
These namespaces occupy the root of `agentstack` and are shared across all
project & frameworks. Methods from these products are generally candidates for 
availability in the public API for use within a project. 


## `agents`
Agents are the actual personalities that accomplish work. We provide tools for
interacting with the `agents.yaml` configuration file in this package. 

### `AgentConfig.__init__(name: str)`
`<AgentConfig>` Initialize an `AgentConfig` to read and modify `agents.yaml` in 
the current project.

### `agents.get_all_agent_names()`
`<List[str]>` This function returns a list of all the agent names in the project.

### `agents.get_all_agents()`
`<List[AgentConfig]>` This function returns a list of all the agents in the project.


## `tasks`
Tasks are the individual units of work that an Agent can perform. `agents` will
use the `tools` they have available to accomplish `tasks`. We provide tools for
interacting with the `tasks.yaml` configuration file in this package.

### `TaskConfig.__init__(name: str)`
`<TaskConfig>` Initialize a `TaskConfig` to read and modify `tasks.yaml` in the
current project.

### `tasks.get_all_task_names()`
`<List[str]>` This function returns a list of all the task names in the project.

### `tasks.get_all_tasks()`
`<List[TaskConfig]>` This function returns a list of all the tasks in the project.


## `inputs`
Inputs are variable data that can be used to configure `tasks`. Behind the scenes
`inputs` are interpolated into `task` prompts to determine their specialization. 
We provide tools for interacting with the `inputs.yaml` configuration file in this
package. 

> TODO: Iterable inputs that can be used to generate `tasks` for multiple sequential runs. 

### `InputsConfig.__init__(name: str)`
`<InputsConfig>` Initialize an `InputsConfig` to read and modify `inputs.yaml` in
the current project.

#### `InputsConfig.__getitem__(key: str)`
`<str>` Instance method to get the value of an input from the `inputs.yaml` file.

#### `InputsConfig.__setitem__(key: str, value: str)`
`<None>` Instance method to set the value of an input in the `inputs.yaml` file.

### `inputs.get_inputs()`
`<dict[str, str]>` This function returns the inputs for a project.

### `inputs.add_input_for_run(key: str, value: str)`
`<None>` This function adds an input for a run to the `inputs.yaml` file. A run
is the current execution of the `agentstack` command (ie. `agentstack run --inputs-foo=bar`)
and inputs set here will not be saved to the project state. 


## `tools`
Tools are implementations from useful third party libraries that are provided 
to Agents in the user's project. Configuration, dependency management, and wrapper 
implementations are provided by AgentStack. Tools implemented at this level are 
framework-agnostic and expose useful implementations as `callable`s for agents to use. 

Details of tool implementations are documented in the [Tools](#tools-1) section.

> TODO: Some frameworks use decorators to prepare tools for use by agents. Determine
what that actually does and if we can do it in an agnostic way that avoids the
need for decorators. Fundamentally a tool is just a `callable` to so we should
be able to keep this simple. 
> TODO: Expose tools to the user's project through `agentstack.tools['tool_name']`
which dynamically generates the wrapped tool based on the active framework.

## `templates`
Templates are configuration data stored in a JSON file that can be used to 
generate an entire project. This is useful for bootstrapping a new project
which adheres to a common pattern or exporting your project to share. 

Templates are versioned, and each previous version provides a method to convert
it's content to the current version. 

> TODO: Templates are currently identified as `proj_templates` since they conflict
with the templates used by `generation`. Move existing templates to be part of
the generation package. 

### `TemplateConfig.from_template_name(name: str)`
`<TemplateConfig>` This function returns a `TemplateConfig` object for a given
template name.

### `TemplateConfig.from_file(path: Path)`
`<TemplateConfig>` This function returns a `TemplateConfig` object for a given
template file path.

### `TemplateConfig.from_url(url: str)`
`<TemplateConfig>` This function returns a `TemplateConfig` object after loading
data from a URL.

### `TemplateConfig.from_json(data: dict)`
`<TemplateConfig>` This function returns a `TemplateConfig` object from a parsed
JSON object.

### `TemplateConfig.write_to_file(filename: Path)`
`<None>` Instance method to serialize and write the `TemplateConfig` data to a file.

### `templates.get_all_template_paths()`
`<List[Path]>` This function returns a list of all the template paths in the project.

### `templates.get_all_template_names()`
`<List[str]>` This function returns a list of all the template names in the project.

### `templates.get_all_templates()`
`<List[TemplateConfig]>` This function returns a list of all the templates in the
project as `TemplateConfig` objects.


## `conf`
Configuration data for the AgentStack application. This includes the path to the
current project directory and the name of the current framework.

### `agentstack.json`
This is the configuration file for a user's project. It contains the project's
configuration and metadata. It can be read and modified directly by accessing 
`conf.ConfigFile`. 

## `log`
AgentStack provides a robust logging interface for tracking and debugging 
agentic workflows. Runs are separated into separate named files for easy tracking
and have standard conventions for outputs from different parts of the system
for parsing. 

> TODO: Logging is not yet this robust. 
> TODO: Rename `logging` to `log` for brevity.

## `serve`
Completed agents can be deployed to the AgentStack cloud service with a single
command. This provides a fast, secure, and publicly available interface for your
agentic workflows.

> TODO: This is under development. 

## `cli`
The command line interface for `agentstack` is provided in this package. Outside
of `main.py` all logic relating to the command line interface resides here. 

> TODO: Code from other parts of the application should always throw exceptions
and leave the CLI to handle error messaging and control flow. 

## `packaging`
We manage dependencies for tools that are added to the project, in addition
to keeping AgentStack up-to-date. 

> TODO: Migrate packaging to use `uv` exclusively.

## `update`
Auto-updates for AgentStack. 


# Tools
> TODO: Tools should be documented here, or in sub-pages of documentation for
an overview of their usage.

# Generation
AgentStack generates code for a number of frameworks. The generated code is
a starting point for a user's project and is meant to be modified and extended
to suit the user's needs.

## `generation.agents`
This is code that creates and modifies the `agents` in a user's project. Agents
include code that is part of a framework-specific entrypoint file.

> TODO: Rename `generation.agent_generation` to `generation.agents`.

## `generation.tasks`
This is code that creates and modifies the `tasks` in a user's project. Tasks
include code that is part of a framework-specific entrypoint file.

> TODO: Rename `generation.task_generation` to `generation.tasks`.

## `generation.tools`
This is code that creates and modifies the `tools` in a user's project. Tools
are imported into the project and available for use by `agents`.

> TODO: Rename `generation.tool_generation` to `generation.tools`.

## `generation.files`
This is code that creates and modifies the `files` in a user's project.

### `.env`
This is the environment file for a user's project. It contains the project's
environment variables. We dynamically modify this file to include relevant
variables to support `tools` that are used in the project.

## `generation.asttools`
Since we're interacting with generated code, we provide a shared toolkit for
common AST operations. 


# Frameworks
AgentStack generates code for a number of frameworks. The generated code is
a starting point for a user's project and is meant to be modified and extended
to suit the user's needs. The `frameworks` package contains code that adapts
general interactions with a framework into a specific implementation.

## `frameworks.FrameworkModule`
This is the base protocol for all framework implementations– all implementations
must implement this protocol.

## `frameworks.crewai`
This is the implementation for the CrewAI framework. CrewAI is a framework for
creating and managing AI agents. All code related specifically to CrewAI is
contained in this package.

## `frameworks.openai_swarms`
> TODO: Add OpenAI Swarms as a framework.

## `frameworks.agency_swarm`
> TODO: Add [VRSEN Agency Swarm](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm?tab=readme-ov-file) as a framework.

## `frameworks.langgraph`
> TODO Add [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) as a framework.
