## Description
Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that delivers concise, real-time answers to user queries by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and web data.
Information retrieval capabilities, providing up-to-date, contextually relevant responses.
This tool enables AI agents to offer more accurate and timely information, improving user interactions and decision-making processes.

Perplexity also cites sources within its responses that your agent can use to validate information.

## Installation

```bash
agentstack tools add perplexity
```

Set the API key
```env
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=...
```

## Usage
Your agent will be able to write and read from memory. Prompt engineering may be required to instruct the agent when it is important to write and read.

Additionally, `mem0` allows for a `user_id` parameter as part of the tool's function call.

One option is to tell the agent to pass in the appropriate user_id when calling the tool. Another option is to set the user_id in this tool via code.
