# Contributing
First of all, __thank you__ for your interest in contributing to AgentStack! Even the smallest contributions help a _ton_.

Our vision is to build the defacto CLI for quickly spinning up an AI Agent project. We want to be the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) of agents. Our inspiration also includes the oh-so-convenient [Angular CLI](https://v17.angular.io/cli).

### Exclusive Contributor Sticker
AgentStack contributors all receive a free sticker pack including an exclusive holographic sticker only available to contributors to the project :)

Once your PR is merge, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvBEnsT8nsQleonJHoWQtHuhbsgUJ0a9IjOqeZbMGkga2NtA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and I'll send your sticker pack out ASAP! <3

## How to Help

Grab an issue from the [issues tab](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack/issues)! Plenty are labelled "Good First Issue". Fork the repo and create a PR when ready!

The best place to engage in conversation about your contribution is in the Issue chat or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JdWkh9tgTQ).

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
   `git clone https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack.git`
   `cd AgentStack`
2. Install agentstack as an edtiable project and set it up for development and testing
   `pip install -e .[dev,test]`
   This will install the CLI locally and in editable mode so you can use `agentstack <command>` to test your latest changes


## Adding Tools
If you're reading this section, you probably have a product that AI agents can use as a tool. We're glad you're here!

Adding tools is easy once you understand the project structure. Our documentation for adding tools is available on our hosted docs [here](https://docs.agentstack.sh/contributing/adding-tools).

## Before creating your PR
Be sure that you are opening a PR using a branch other than `main` on your fork. This enables us
to pull your branch and make modifications to the PR with your permission that may be helpful.

### Formatting
AgentStack uses Ruff formatter for consistent code formatting. To format your code, run:
```bash
pip install ruff
ruff format .
```

### Type Checking
AgentStack uses MyPy for type checking. To check types, run:
```bash
mypy agentstack
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks
Ruff and MyPy can be run as pre-commit hooks. To enable these hooks, run:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Tests
CLI tests are a bit hacky, so we are not tracking coverage. 
That said, _some_ testing is required for any new functionality added by a PR.

Tests MUST pass to have your PR merged. We _will not_ allow main to be in a failing state, so if your tests are failing, this is your problem to fix.

### Run tests locally
Install the testing requirements
```bash
pip install 'agentstack[test]'
```

Then run tests in all supported python versions with
```bash
tox
```

## Need Help?
If you're reading this, we're very thankful you wanted to contribute! I understand it can be a little overwhelming to 
get up to speed on a project like this and we are here to help!

### Open a draft PR
While we can't promise to write code for you, if you're stuck or need advice/help, open a draft PR and explain what you were trying to build and where you're stuck! Chances are, one of us have the context needed to help you get unstuck :)

### Chat on our Discord
We have an active [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JdWkh9tgTQ) with contributors and AgentStack users! There is a channel just for contributors on there. Feel free to drop a message explaining what you're trying to build and why you're stuck. Someone from our team should reply soon!

# Thank You!
