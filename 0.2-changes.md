# 0.2 Roadmap

# Concepts
- Support only CrewAI for now
- Make the process of starting an agent project as easy as possible

# How do we get there
- Understand current agent design
- What are the use cases? How can they be categorized?

# CLI

### Copilot
- Understand a problem space
- Support decision-making
- Predict next steps

## Templates
Are the templates part of cookiecutter, then structure is generated using the code-gen scripts? 
Or do we manage a collection of independent cookiecutter templates.

The options:

### Codegen
This strategy involves using the existing and new codegen scripts to take the base project template and systematically 
build off of it.

This would require a templating structure that can handle complex agent designs.

Pros:
- More easily extensible
- Helps prevent some templates lagging behind in updates

Cons:
- More complex design. Requires more work on codegen and is a more difficult pattern to understand
- Contributions will be more challenging
- There may be some templates that this design may not account for

### Cookiecutter
With this strategy, every template would be its own Cookiecutter template.

Pros:
- Much simpler to understand
- No bounds on complexity or variation between templates

Cons:
- Tech debt will easily grow
  - Every update will require a change to every single template
  - Requires robust processes for keeping every template updated

## Decision
We'll move forward with the codegen method unless other information comes to light.


### `agentstack i <project_name>`
- Flags
  - `--in-place`
    - dont place into a subdirectory
  - `--template <template_name>`
    - generate the project according to a template
    - can also consume a url

### `agentstack tools`
- Stays the same

### `agentstack generate`
- `agent`
  - `--template <agent_name>`
-
